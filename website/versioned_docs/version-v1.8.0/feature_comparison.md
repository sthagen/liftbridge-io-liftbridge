Liftbridge shares some similarities with other stream-oriented pub/sub
messaging systems. The below feature-comparison matrix shows how it compares to
a few of these systems. 

> **Architect's Note**
>
> These are highly nuanced pieces of infrastructure, so a straight comparison
> of features is often of minimal value when evaluating solutions. This matrix
> is primarily meant to serve as a reference point for those attempting to
> develop a mental model of Liftbridge.
